# presynaptic-NMDA-receptors

The SC-CA1 synapse and presynaptic NMDA receptors

See Figure in McGuinness et al., Presynaptic NMDARs in the Hippocampus Facilitate Transmitter Release at Theta Frequency, Neuron, 2010.

Facilitation is nonexistent at 1 Hz, strong at 5 Hz, and weak at 20 Hz.   Conditions: Black=control, Gray=NMDA receptors blocked.  



Conditions: Blue=control, Red=NMDA receptors blocked.

TO DO: simulation results depend on the distance of preNMDARs and VGCCs from the docked vesicle.   

<list>
<li>when preNMDARs were closer than VGCCs to the docked vesicle. 
<li>when preNMDARs were farther than VGCCs from the docked vesicle. 
</list>

Conditions: Blue=control, Red=NMDA receptors blocked.
